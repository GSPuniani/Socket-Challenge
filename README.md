<i>ACS 3210: Socket Challenge</i>

This is a simple Node.js chat webapp built using the [Socket.io](https://socket.io) library to implement WebSockets. This project is based on [this Socket.io tutorial](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/). In addition to the full tutorial, the following suggested challenges were also implemented in this project:

- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects
- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone disconnects
- Broadcast each user's message to everyone except the sender
